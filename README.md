# NewRelic.org 'For Good' NGO Validation Service TechSoup Integration

![CI](https://github.com/newrelic/nr-ngo-validation-serverless/workflows/Push/badge.svg) ![GitHub release (latest SemVer including pre-releases)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/newrelic/nr-ngo-validation-serverless?include_prereleases&sort=semver) ![GitHub Tag](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/newrelic/nr-ngo-validation-serverless) [![Snyk](https://snyk.io/test/github/newrelic/nr-ngo-validation-serverless/badge.svg)](https://snyk.io/test/github/newrelic/nr-ngo-validation-serverless)

The 'For Good' Validation Service is designed to check the program eligibility of any NGO using TechSoup's API. In addition the standard response provided by the Techsoup API, this project provides functions like checking token and account validity and checking validation history before issuing a request to TechSoup. The repository contains 8 lambdas:

- get-lookup-response: allow user to fetch LLR from the database,
- get-validation-history: allow user to fetch history of validation from database. We are supporting AuroraDB with Postgres right now,
- get-validation-history-adm: allow admin to fetch history of validation from database. We are supporting AuroraDB with Postgres right now,
- manual-approval: allow for manual approval of a user by NR employees,
- update-llr: allows for an update of large lookup response on the database,
- save-attempts: allow user to save validation attempt to the database,
- validate-account: check if the account already exist in the database, if yes then return the last validation date with the eligibility status,
- validate-token: check if token provided by user is correct and last use was 30 days ago,
- validator: core function to check eligibility staus based on Tech Soup APIs (Lookup API and Constraint API). Fetches data from those two sources to return the result for the user

## Installation

### Requirements

- Serverless framework
- NodeJS in version 14 minimum
- TechSoup API Access

## Getting Started

Before installation set environmental variables in `.env` file. This file contains the REGION and STAGE variables. If those variable will be empty the default values will be provided:

- STAGE=<stage_of_lambda_deployment>
- REGION=<region_where_to_deploy_lambda>
- LOOKUP_API_URL=<url_to_lookup_api>
- CONSTRAINT_API_URL=<url_to_constraint_api>
- CONSTRAINT_ID=<your_constraint_id>
- SESSION_KEY=<your_session_key>
- DATABASE_RESOURCE_ARN=<database_resource_arn>
- DATABASE_SECRET_ARN=<database_secret_arn>
- DATABASE=<database_name>
- DATABASE_CLUSTER_NAME=<cluster_name>
- NR_ACCOUNT_ID=<nr_account_id_for_monitoring>
- NR_API_KEY=<nr_api_key_for_account_to_monitoring>

If you have serverless framework installed, type `npm install` and `sls offline` in your terminal in the project folder.

## Usage

The lambda can be used in two way - offline and from your AWS account. The offline method is for testing purposes only and can be run with command `sls offline`. To deploy lambda function to the AWS, first you need to add to the `.aws/credentials` your client credential from your AWS. The section in the credentials could looks like:

> [profile name]
> aws_access_key_id = <your_key>
> aws_secret_access_key = <your_secret_key>
> region = <your_region>

After that you can deploy the lambda to your AWS space by using command `sls deploy --aws-profile <your_profile_name>`

After deployment it is recommended to do a sync of terraform states with s3 bucket in case of staging environment the sync is done automatically, in case of production deplopyment the following command should be used:

```bash
aws s3 sync .serverless s3://${BUCKET_NAME} --exclude "*" --include "validation-service.zip"
```

## Deployment notes

Errors/warnings in GH Actions to ignore:

- Deploy on tag
  - Deploy Lambda Functions
    - `Cannot find module 'newrelic' or its corresponding type declarations.`
    - `Warning: Unable to find NR License key for extension validation; falling back to CloudWatch for transport.`
    - `Warning: Function "..." already will be handled with provider.layers; skipping.`
    - `Warning: No New Relic AWS Lambda integration found for this New Relic linked account and aws account.`
    - `Error while creating the New Relic AWS Lambda cloud integration: Error: ["data.cloudLinkAccount missing in response"].`

## Testing

To run all tests type `npm test` in your terminal in project folder.

You can import collection from tests/integration_tests.json to Postman and setup context. After deployment you should test if endpoints work (with and without api key)

## Requests to each lambda function

In this section you can find description of each lambda (endpoint) with parameters required to make a call to API.
Validates the eligibility status of the NGO using Tech Soup APIs (Constraint API and Lookup API).

## Defined Error Codes

During the verification process the Lambda sends request to the Lookup API then to Constraint API. We have defined internal response codes and error codes from the Constraint API. We are handling responses from Lookup API with our internal codes - for example invalid toke format.

## Additional information

If you want to validate if the organisation is matching in your system/flow you need to implement this method by yourself. The definition of this method you'll find in `src/utils/org-validator.ts`.
